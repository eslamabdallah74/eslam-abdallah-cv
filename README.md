> Creating a SaaS project centered around a multi-tenant architecture, reminiscent of platforms like Shopify. This entailed crafting individual websites and subdomains for each seller, with data segregation achieved through both a single and multi-database approach. To facilitate this, I effectively utilized the Tenancy for Laravel package. The project was designed as a RESTful API, harmonizing with the React-based front-end team. Notably, the comprehensive website encompassed a spectrum of features, including intricate settings, geofencing capabilities, cart management, tax computation, and promotional functionalities. Moreover, the implementation featured sophisticated product recommendations and other quintessential elements of an e-commerce ecosystem
